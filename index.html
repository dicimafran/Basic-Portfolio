            <p>I am a coffee and tea addict. I can't really live without it. Caffeine is love. Caffeine is life.</p>
            <p>In my spare time you'll probably find me playing videogames, creating art, or reading. </p>
            <p>I'm not exactly the best cook. I can bake a bit, but I can't be trusted with fried foods. My last attempt at cooking a croquette yielded a sad and pathetic pile of charred dark matter, unsuitable for human consumption. It was a mistake.</p>
            <p>I have an irrational fear of butterflies. They are very pretty to look at, but I freak out the moment they try to land on me.</p>
